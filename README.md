# Biomarker-Analysis---Lung-Cancer
Overview

This repository contains code, data, and resources for analyzing biomarkers associated with lung cancer. We aim to identify key biomarkers that can aid in early detection, prognosis, and personalized treatment strategies for lung cancer patients. The analysis focuses on statistical, bioinformatics, and machine learning techniques to process and interpret biomarker data.

Background

Biomarkers are biological indicators, often detectable in blood or tissue samples, that can indicate the presence or progression of diseases. For lung cancer, identifying reliable biomarkers is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy, determining prognosis, and guiding treatment decisions. This repository explores potential biomarkers using multi-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.

Data Sources

Data sources used in this repository include:

Public Databases: Such as GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus).

Clinical Data: Includes information on patient demographics, treatment history, and survival outcomes.

Genomics Data: Gene concept that pulls together multiple sources of functional annotations downloaded from DAVID (the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery)
